            <p class="paragraph">Cox's Bazar is famous for its long natural sandy sea beach. I have been to Cox's Bazar
                in all seasons and
                many times over the last 20 years or so. And I would love to share my practical experience with you!
                Even 20 years ago Cox's Bazar was relatively a small town. There were lots of hotels, motels and guest
                houses for tourists' accommodations and restaurants for having a variety of great food still there at
                around that time. But, over the years Cox's Bazar has been transformed into a busy tourist city. It has
                more international visitors now than ever....</p>
